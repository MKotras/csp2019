			<p>Hello, my name is Matthew Kotras, I am 17 currently and to be honest most of my hobbies are video game related. I am interested in programming and currently I have been learning to make plugins for a game to make things a bit easier. My biggest goal for this school year is to stay on top of my classes and do as much as possible for this one in particular.</p>
